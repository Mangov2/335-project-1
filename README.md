Project 1 - Algorithm Engineering
Overview
This project implements two algorithms:

Custom Priority Queue - A queue that can operate in three modes: Priority Queue, Stack, and FIFO Queue.

Robo-Add - Merging two linked lists representing numbers in reverse order.

Run the script:
python custom_priority_queue.py - Example outputs demonstrate how the priority queue, stack, and queue behave.

Running the Robo-Add Algorithm

Run the script:
python robo_add_linkedlist.py- The output will display the sum of two linked lists representing numbers.
