Project: Custom Priority Queue & Robo-Add Algorithm

Algorithm 1: Custom Priority Queue
The custom priority queue supports three modes:
Priority Queue Mode: Uses a min-heap (heapq) for ordering.
Stack Mode: Implements a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
Queue Mode: Implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.

Priority Queue Mode:
push(): O(log n) (heap insertion)
pop(): O(log n) (heap removal)
Stack Mode:
push(): O(1) (list append)
pop(): O(1) (list pop)
Queue Mode:
push(): O(1) (list insert at index 0)
pop(): O(1) (list pop from the end)

Algorithm 2: Robo-Add (Merging Linked Lists)
Two linked lists representing reversed numbers are added digit by digit.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longer linked list (single pass solution).
Space Complexity: O(n), as a new linked list is created for the result.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates an efficient implementation of a flexible priority queue and an optimized linked list addition algorithm.
